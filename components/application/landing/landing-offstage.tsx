/**
 * Offstage discipline for the landing page's sections.
 *
 * The page is a stage full of live components — marquee cards, an assembling
 * collage, app-shell demos, seventeen charts — and left alone every one of
 * them renders, animates, and rasterizes all the time, whether or not it is
 * anywhere near the viewport. That is what the "citiesoft.com using 1.3GB ram"
 * screenshots are made of.
 *
 * `LandingOffstage` wraps a section and does two things while it is far from
 * the viewport:
 *
 *   - `content-visibility: auto` lets the browser skip layout and paint for
 *     the subtree entirely (the DOM stays — SSR HTML, SEO, and find-in-page
 *     are unaffected). `contain-intrinsic-size` reserves an estimated height
 *     so the scrollbar doesn't breathe; the `auto` keyword swaps in the real
 *     measured height once a section has been rendered once.
 *
 *   - `data-offstage` is set, and a global rule holds every CSS animation
 *     inside (marquee track, loader dashes, shimmer sweeps) at its current
 *     frame — the compositor otherwise keeps animating skipped content.
 *
 * JS-driven loops (motion values, timers, WebGL) can't be paused from CSS;
 * components that run one read `useOffstageNear()` and hold their own clocks.

/**
 * Nearness is deliberately three-valued. `null` means "not established yet" —
 * the server render and the frames before the observer's first report. Code
 * that STOPS work should do so only on a firm `false` (never punish the
 * pre-observer window), and code that STARTS extra work should wait for a
 * firm `true` (never mount a heavy demo on a guess).
